    IMPORTANT STYLISTIC INSTRUCTIONS:
    1.  **Emulate Human Thought Patterns:** Write in a style that mimics a human author. Vary sentence length and structure significantly. Use a mix of short, punchy sentences and longer, more complex ones. This is known as "burstiness".
    2.  **Avoid AI ClichÃ©s:** Do not use common AI transition phrases like "In conclusion," "Furthermore," "Moreover," "It is important to note that," or "Overall." Instead, integrate transitions naturally.
    3.  **Use Active Voice:** Prefer active voice over passive voice to make the text more engaging and direct.
    4.  **Inject Personality (Subtly):** While maintaining a formal academic tone, write with confidence and conviction. The flow should feel natural, not like a robotic enumeration of facts.
    5.  **Perplexity and Nuance:** The text should have a high degree of perplexity, reflecting the complexity of human writing. Introduce nuanced arguments and avoid oversimplification.
